# ETHGlobal AI Event Video Automation

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project is a **fully-automated, AI-powered workflow** for ETHGlobal event videos.  
It transforms hours of manual work into minutes using a team of AI agents to generate:

- Summaries
- Chapters
- Keywords
- YouTube and Drive links
- Partner notification messages

All outputs are beautifully and automatically filled into a **presentable Google Sheet** with clickable hyperlinks.  
No copy-paste or reformatting is needed.

## üéØ Problem We Solved

Collaborating on ETHGlobal event content used to mean:

- Juggling video uploads, transcripts, links, and summaries by hand
- Writing YouTube chapters, descriptions, keywords manually
- Creating partner outreach one-by-one
- Spreadsheets with ugly, unclickable URLs

This cost us **3‚Äì4+ hours per 10 videos** and wasted valuable team time.

## üí° Solution

With our AI pipeline:

- **One upload:** Drop a video and transcript Google Doc in "Video Uploads" and "Transcripts" on Google Drive
- **Instant magic:**
  - AI agents auto-detect new videos
  - Parse event/speaker/partner info from file names (no manual entry)
  - Extract YouTube links, summary, chapters, keywords
  - Fill a Sheet row with all info, using human-friendly hyperlinks/buttons
  - Draft a ready-to-send notification for partners (Telegram/email)
- **Scalable:** Works for 1 or 100 videos‚Äîsame number of clicks
- **Presentable:** All deliverables are ready for sharing or publishing

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Why This Matters

- **Saves 90%+ operational time**
- **Zero copy/paste**
- **Error-proof data**
- **Instantly shareable across teams/partners**
- Beautiful, scalable, and "plug and play" for new events

## üõ†Ô∏è How To Use

1. **Prepare folders:**  
   - `Video Uploads` (for edited .mp4 files)  
   - `Transcripts` (matching Google Docs, title matches video)
   - Both shared with the Google service account

2. **Prepare your event videos and transcripts:**  
   - Transcript Doc title must exactly match the video.

3. **Run the agent:**  
   - Click "Run" in the Python/Replit project.
   - Within seconds, you‚Äôll get:
       - A clickable Google Sheet row for every video
       - Summaries, chapters, keywords, notification drafts, and all links

4. **Share, publish, notify partners:**  
   - Use the Sheet‚Äôs links/messages to blast out to partners, YouTube, etc.
